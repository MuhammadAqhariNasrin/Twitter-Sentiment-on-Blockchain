Created a Python application for classification of data either positive, negative or neutral.

Gathering and cleaning: - Scraped data from twitter using tweepy library in Python, which communicates with the twitter API and built functions to clean, parse and tokenize the tweets.
Visualization and Extraction: - Cleaned data is visualized in WordCloud format and extracted features for the same using natural language processing.
Classification:- Built a Na√Øve Bayes classifier from the scikit-learn library to detect the nature of tweets from the set of features extracted in Python.
